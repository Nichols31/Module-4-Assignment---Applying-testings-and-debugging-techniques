Debugging

Explanation:
Usage of Variables Before Declaration:

The variables firstTest, secondTest, and average are used before they are declared. Declarations should come before their first use.

Logical Error in the While Loop:

The while loop condition should be checked after the input of firstTest to prevent the use of uninitialized variables.
